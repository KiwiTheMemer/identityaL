Every March dog sledding teams gather from around the world in Anchorage for “The Last Great Race On Earth.” The race takes participants (called “mushers”) over 1,000 miles of frozen lakes and mountain ranges until they (somehow) reach the finish line in Nome. It’s a huge deal here and brings everyone out to celebrate.

Every Saturday and Sunday, head to the heart of downtown for Alaska’s largest outdoor market. The Anchorage Market & Festival provides locals with everything from fresh, Alaskan-grown produce, meat, and gourmet foods, to handmade jewelry and hand-stitched clothing from over 300 vendors.

Every winter downtown Anchorage is turned into a 3D art gallery as the snow and ice are brought to life. The Crystal Gallery Of Ice competition brings ice sculptors from all around to carve their masterpieces in giant chunks of ice, and the results are nothing short of spectacular.

Anchorage is very diverse. There are large military populations, large oil-company populations, large Alaska Native populations, large ethnic minority populations (mainly from Asia & Pacific Island nations) and lots of other people just seeking an adventurous life.
